# Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
# You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

# The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue;
# and since our input array also consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.

# two pointers: low, high = 0, len - 1
# while left < right:
#   put all the 0s before low and all the 2s after high.
#   left with sorted array (1s between low and high)
