# You are given an nÃ—m board B with some amount of coins in each cell. Traverse the board
# from the top left to the bottom right corner of B, collecting the coins in each cell that you
# step on. (You will always collect the value in the top left and bottom right corners.) During
# the traversal you can only step into an adjacent cell either to the right or below your current
# location. That is, from B[i, j] you can only go to B[i + 1, j] or B[i, j + 1]. Find the best
# route to collect the maximum total amount of coins. The input to your algorithm is a table
# B with B[i, j] containing the money amount at location [i, j].
