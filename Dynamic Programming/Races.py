# You are training for the Boston Marathon by running various shorter races.
# There is one race every week. You have developed your own point system where for each race you
# award yourself a number of fitness points, based on how much you will gain from doing that race. Plan out
# which races to run so that you are as fit as possible by Marathon Day. As input you get the dates of the n
# races and the amount of points for each day in a table F. Design a dynamic programming algorithm for the
# below problems.
